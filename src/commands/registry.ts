// A `Command` is a *value* — a description of an action and its gating.
// Dynamic fields (title that flips between "Refresh" and "Retry", a disabled
// reason that depends on selection state) are expressed as atoms, evaluated
// against the live registry whenever the palette renders. `run` is an Effect:
// when dispatched it has full access to the GitHub/cache/observability
// layered runtime and to Atom.set/Atom.get for state changes.
//
// Commands never close over component-local state. Any value a command needs
// to read goes through an atom — that's what makes them dispatchable from
// keymap, palette, or any future surface without re-threading dependencies.
